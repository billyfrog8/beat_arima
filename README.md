# Can you beat ARIMA forecasts?
In my time series forecasting class I didn't exactly believe in the power of simple ARIMA models. I always thought I could simply draw a line and get about the same accuracy. Well it turns out ARIMA is often better than me, but more importantly in my opinion unbiased. I made a simple game using real stock price data to try to draw a line that would beat an autofitted ARIMA model at forecasting 10 periods into the future.
